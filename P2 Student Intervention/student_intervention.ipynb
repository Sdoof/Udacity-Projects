Gaussian NB, being a non-parametric model, is also the easiest model to use as it requires no fine tuning. It can also be \ntrained\nquickly (both developer time and CPU time). It is also an easy model to explain. Finally, \n\n2) Decision Tree is probably the easiest model to explain. However, it suffers from poor performance and has many\nparameters that require fine tuning for an accurate model. It is easy to overfit/underfit decision tree models due to the number\nof parameters. A decision tree also creates linear divisions in the given data for the classification (which is an unfounded\nassumption in our case).\n\n3) Linear SVMs have the best performance among selected models and have only 1 significant parameter (relative cost of incorrect\nclassification, 'C') to fine tune, making them easy to use. Unfortunately, SVMs are difficult to explain to a lay person as\nthey involve transforming the given data before classifying them. SVMs are also preferred over other classifiers (such as logistic\nregression) for data involving high number of features, which is not the case here.\n\n'''\nclf_dt = DecisionTreeClassifier()\nclf_svm

Use Gridsearch with at least one important parameter tuned and with at least 3 settings. Use the entire training set for this.\n- What is the model's final F<sub>1</sub> score?", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "\nComparison of models:\n Below are the pros and cons of using each model.\n \n| Classifier           | F1 Score    | Speed     | Other Issues          |\n|----------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| Decision Tree        | Poor        | Fast      | Overfitted            |\n| Linear SVM           | Good        | Slow      | Difficult to explain  | \n| Gaussian Naive Bayes | Good        | Fast      | None                  | \n\nAt this stage, I'd recommend the Gaussian Naive Bayes model to the board of supervisors.\nIt has strong performance, doesn't suffer from the risk of being over fitted and can be trained very quickly. It also has the benefit of being easy to explain.\n\nThe model makes a prediction for a given student as follows:\n- For each possible classification (In our case, the classifications are Pass/Fail), the model calculates the probability that the given data belongs to that classification (In our case, the model calculates two probabilities, Probability of Passing and Probability of Failing). The classification (pass/fail) predicted for a new student is simply one with highest probability. Specifically, in our case the model generates two probabilities: P<sub>F</sub>, the predicted probability that the given student would fail and P<sub>P</sub>, the predicted probability that the given student would pass. The predicted outcome (Pass/Fail) is the one which has greater probability.\n\nAs an example, let's consider how the probability of passing is calculated: \n- To calculate P<sub>P</sub>, the model uses Bayes rule, i.e. the probability of classification given some feature (features are list of data that is known for a student, e.g. 'distance from home', 'Mother's job' etc.) values can be derived from:\n    - probability of feature values given the classification; and\n    - probability of classification itself\n\ne.g. if our only available feature was whether or not the Guardian was mother or not, then predicted probability of a student with guardian mother passing equals [probability of having a guardian mother for a passing student (a) x probability of any student passing (b) / probability of any student having a guarding mother (c)]\n\nAll 3 probabilities, (a), (b) and (c) can be readily seen from the training data.\n    \n    \nThe model makes two simplifying assumptions:\n    - For continuous features (non-nominal), the model assumes underlying distribution is Gaussian. \n    - The model assumes all features are independent of each other, i.e. probability of two features values occuring together (e.g. 'Guardian Mother' and 'Male Sex') is same as product of probabilities of the feature values occuring independently, i.e. probability of 'Guardian Mother' x probability of 'Male Sex'\n\nThe first assumption only comes into picture for features which are not labels (ordered) or classifications themselves. Consider 'absences' which is a number greater than 0. To calculate probability (a), i.e. probability of a feature value given that the student passed, we first calculate the mean and variance of 'absences' feature for for all the students who Passed. Then we can find the conditional probability mentioned above by using the parameterized Normal distribution equation (or it can be looked up in z-tables).\n\nThe second assumption can easily seen to be misleading: e.g. 'health' and 'absences' are likely not independent features. Practically, this means one of those features may affect the other. e.g. students with better health are likely to have fewer absences. However, despite this limitation, the model performs very well with real life data and is able to predict with high accuracy and precision.\n\n<b> Since Gaussian NB is a non-parametric model, it can't be further fine tuned. To explore fine-tuning, we select a Linear SVC model. </b>\n\n1) Reasonable Training and Prediction times: While SVCs are not as fast as Gaussian NBs and Decision Trees, due to small training set, these are not primary concerns.\n2) Very strong performance: Linear SVC has comparable performance to Gaussian NB prior to fine tuning. We expect it to outperform the Naive Bayes model post fine tuning.\n\nPrior to making a prediction, the Linear SVC model is trained as follows:\nTo start, the model assigns a sign +/- to each of the two classes of data (Pass/Fail).\n\nThe model uses training data to discover the hyper-plane which optimizes the trade-off between, a) Maximizing the distance between the closest data points belonging to the two classes (pass/fail) and, b) ensuring that all data points are correctly classified. \n\nBased on the vector w, normal to the hyper-plane, discovered from training data, the prediction of classification of un-seen data is simply sign of (dot product of w and x + b) where x is the unseen data and b is the parameter which determines the offset of the hyper-plane from origin (the offset is b/||w||).\n\nWe can fine tune the model by setting the penalty for 'wrong classification' in training data by using parameter 'C'. We do so\nbelow using GridSearchCV to fine tune the model over 20 different values of C.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"collapsed": true}}, {"execution_count": 18, "cell_type": "code", "source": "from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score, make_scorer\ndef fit_model(clf, X, y):\n    ''' Tunes a classification model using GridSearchCV on the input data X \n        and target labels y and returns this optimal model.
